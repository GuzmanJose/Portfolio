As the gameplay advances the player will need to learn more about the surroundings and the tools that will help him in the difficult task of surviving the different menaces that are pending in each part of this strange journey.",
		"process": "I created the entire level from the design and sketches to the modeling, animation and programming of all the elements that you will run into inside this VR video game.<br><br>At the beginning of this project I pictured this video game a little more simplistic and with a different type of hardware. After getting some advice from Professor Clay Ewing I decided to experiment with a more aggressive approach and a more powerful VR hardware.<br><br>After practicing and experimenting with different types of VR hardwares I chose the <b>HTC Vive</b> because it’s one of the best immersive experiences I’ve had so far. The precision of the sensors and the ability to move in a confined area gives a huge advantage to the <b>HTC Vive</b> above other VR hardwares.<br><br>Creating the world wasn’t an easy task. It was necessary to learn how to use a 3D modeling software like <b>Maya</b> before trying anything else. At first I learned how to use the basics of <b>Maya</b> by doing very simple models of trees and after some practice, I was able to generate different assets that will help me to create this VR videogame.<br><br>The environment and gameplay had different versions due to the fact that VR is a very unique medium and you need to consider different conditions that at the beginning doesn’t seem to be very obvious. That’s why you need to experiment and play with everything you create in order to make it realistic. -<i>even if it’s something impossible to believe</i>- It needs to feel realistic.<br><br>You have to also consider that the player will want to do things that are not possible due to the limitations of the VR hardwares. For example at the beginning the environment was a forest without any boundaries. But the player is confined to the area of the <b>HTC Vive</b> and unless you give him a method to teletransport their position the player will have the urge to explore and discover all the little details of that world. That’s how I decided to create natural boundaries that will limit the player to a designated area.<br><br>After testing the project and the feedback received from different users I came out with a very fulfilling result.",

		"description": "This car was made with different type of legos, a differential gear in the back, and a lego steering system in the front controlled by 2 servo motors that at the same time are powered by two 9V batteries. I also included enough space in the middle to support 2 breadboards and a microcontroller. Also a bluetooth module so I can control the direction and power with a gesture control armband.",
		"process": "At first I just tried to create a car made of legos that I could move with one servo motor connected to a microcontroller (<b>Arduino uno</b>). I had different stages of development while working on this project. The first stage was just a simple car with a button that will turn on and off the servo motor. -<i>That was my first milestone making the car move forward</i>-.<br><br>I had to redesign the structure of the car so I could add the steering system and the second servo motor. I ran a second test by adding a script to the microcontroller that will change the direction of the car every 5 seconds. -<i>Second milestone the car moves forward and can change direction</i>-.<br><br>After having different ideas for how to control the car I remembered that the school had an <b>MYO</b> armband that I could use for my project. By using a second breadboard I was able to connect a bluetooth module to the <b>Arduino UNO</b> and create a bridge between the <b>Myo</b> armband, my PC, and the bluetooth module inside the car.<br><br>It was possible by using the <b>Myoduino</b> library from the developers of <b>Thalmyc labs</b> that connects the <b>Myo</b> armband to  the arduino microcontrollers. Of course I needed to make a little hack to the library in order to send the signal via bluetooth instead of the standard usb cable.-<i>Final stage, I was able to control the arduino car via bluetooth with a control gesture armband</i>-.",
