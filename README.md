## Developer • Illustrator • Designer

I am a creative developer with a graphic design and illustration background who is focusing on the playfulness of technology and the simplicity of video games. I had traveled from graphic design and classic illustration to front-end and back-end development in order to arrive to the sweet land of game design and development where I found myself not just happy but fulfilled.
